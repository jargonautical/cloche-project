                    <p>We’ve already talked a bit about the context of open data in local government specifically. 
                    This post is an attempt to semi-formally define data inclusion as a field of study or work. 
                    It’s a bit of a strawman and we’re open to suggestions, but it’s how we think of it at the moment. 
                    We are practitioners, not academics, and we’re doing this so we can start to create a community of practice.<br>
                    <blockquote><strong><em>Data Inclusion</em></strong> <em>means a set of standards, tools, and 
                    practices that ensure public data is understandable and consumable by all parts of the general 
                    public.</em></blockquote><br>
                    Public data is data, assembled with the public in mind and with the right presentation and 
                    explanation, that ensures it can be used for the purposes <i>the public intend</i>.
                    There are some adjacent topics which it’s worth mentioning so that we focus on what Data 
                    Inclusion is rather than what it isn’t:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.wea-ni.com/digital-age-project/what-is-digital-inclusion">Digital Inclusion
                    </a> – the incorporation of information technologies into the community in order to promote 
                    education and improve the quality of life – in practice this has focused on getting people 
                    online and helping them to use digital technologies, as typified by the great work of 
                    <a href="http://www.ukonlinecentres.com/">UKOnline centres</a>.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/Overview.html">W3C Accessibility guidelines</a> 
                    which focus on making the web technically easier to access. Technical accessibility is a 
                    facet of open and public data but does not, on its own, make data inclusive.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/">Plain English</a> which focuses on making 
                    communications accessible, but does not yet cover communication around data as a specialist topic.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.infodesign.org.uk/What-is-information-design/definitions">Information 
                    Design</a> is concerned with a design approach to all kinds of communication around complex 
                    topics, but does not focus on the challenges we face with public data.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <strong>What should data inclusion do?</strong><br>
                    If we are to have a community of practice, then that practice must be working to a set of 
                    outcomes. The way we see it these might be:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Public data must be available and understandable by everyone, regardless of ability.</li>
                    <li>Public data always has an identifiable public user with identifiable jobs to be done, 
                    and the data is tested against these groups of people for legibility.</li>
                    <li>Public data can be provided in computer-legible format (ie as open data) as long as it 
                    is also provided in human-readable format (ie as “plain data” or “inclusive data” – we don’t 
                    have a good name for this and are open to suggestions).</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <strong>Principles</strong><br>
                    <em>Accuracy: </em>To be inclusive, public data must have a trail to the raw or 
                    open datasets and show explanations or visualisations of the actual data, which must not 
                    be distorted. Elements should be accurately sized.<br>
                    <em>Brevity: </em>Accessible public data cannot distract the viewer or reader with design, 
                    methodology, or other things – the focus must be on communicating the substance. The data 
                    must serve a clear, stated and verifiable public purpose. The data could, however, reveal 
                    several layers of detail with drill-down mechanisms.<br>
                    <em>Clarity: </em>Making large datasets coherent and clear requires, at the very least, 
                    clear labelling of data and appropriate scaling of axes (if graphs are used). Visualisations 
                    should use colour without the introduction of bias and promote navigability and interactivity –
                     letting people interact with the data themselves and derive their own insights.<br><br>
