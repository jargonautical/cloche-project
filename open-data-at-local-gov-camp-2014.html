                    <p>We were lucky enough to be able to attend <a href="http://localgovdigital.info/localgovcamp/">
                    LocalGovCamp</a> in Birmingham on the 21st June, and pitch a session on 
                    "Getting the best out of Open Data".
                    Broadly the premise of this session was that everyone already agrees that 
                    open data is a Good Thing, but that we still aren't quite in the fast lane in 
                    terms of delivering the benefits it promises. Too many datasets lie unused (or underused), 
                    and too few of the right datasets are still unreleased, as well as there being a 
                    general lack of understanding of what we might do with the data in the future.
                    <br>These are quite rough notes, so if anyone who was at the session thinks 
                    of some additions or corrections please send them through!
                    We started by introducing ourselves - it felt a bit stiff and formal for a GovCamp 
                    but I didn't know how else to get started. A wide range of people were there from public 
                    and private sectors -around 15 people in all which was a good number.<br><br>
                    <strong>Communities</strong><br>
                    The first topic the group tackled was about community management and 
                    how to bring together a like-minded community of people to start to exploit 
                    local open data opportunities. "Relationships are more important than platforms" is 
                    the brief but pithy note I made.
                    Some people had applied to be an ODI Node - basically a DIY franchise where you run 
                    a mini-ODI in your local area. Leeds and Manchester are two already in the UK,  and 
                    I know that Exeter and Bristol have both also expressed a strong interest. It's 
                    an international thing and you can be a node virtually anywhere: there's lots more information 
                    on the <a href="http://theodi.org/nodes">ODI site</a>.
                    <br>The group talked a bit about the challenges of dealing with lots of diverse "meetups" 
                    that might happen locally and how a council open data lead might access them without 
                    appearing to be trying to impose control. It was suggested that in Chicago the authorities 
                    just chose one meetup and made a firm commitment to support it. People from other groups could 
                    then access them via that one meetup. This kind of goes against the grain of local government 
                    a bit - we love to be inclusive - but it's probably the only practical way forward.
                    <br><br><strong>Dog food</strong><br>
                    Discussion then veered off onto how data was being used internally in organisations and 
                    the consensus was that Local government is really bad at using its own data. If we are going 
                    to serve open data out to the wider world , how about we use it ourselves to support decision-making?
                    There are some pockets of good practice in the area of data-driven decision making: 
                    for example, Cambridgeshire are using open data sets to support decisions in economic 
                    development and housing. It seems that a lot of good practice is submerged along with its 
                    (not yet open) data sets right now. Data stores like the <a href="http://protohub.net/">Hampshire Hub</a> 
                    are intended to improve this – across lots of organisations.
                    Local Government already have some tools like LGINform, but the point was made that it wasn't 
                    quite open data and it still needed a council officer to drive it.<br><br>
                    <strong>Barriers</strong><br>
                    There was some talk about the barriers to opening up data sets and the challenges we are tasked 
                    with overcoming, such as:<br>
                    <ul>
	                    <li><em>confidentiality</em> of any data containing personally identifying information.</li>
	                    <li><em>effort vs reward</em> - is there an ROI case for opening a particular data set? 
	                    Obviously ROI improves once you have automated methods of opening up data sets.</li>
	                    <li><em>utility</em> - is it useful to someone in some way and how do we establish that? 
	                    Someone mentioned that open data needs a specific application with a problem to solve. 
	                    Whilst true, I also think that we should be releasing stuff without knowing what will be done with it.</li>
	                    <li><em>reputation</em> - if we release this, will we look like wazzocks?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Socrata's <a href="http://www.socrata.com/open-data-field-guide/">Open Data Field Guide </a>got a 
                    mention, and there seemed broad agreement that precedent and stories are quite powerful and could be an 
                    antidote to these sorts of barriers. We floated the idea of creating a collection of stories from all over about what 
                    has been done and the benefits (or other effects).
                    We also talked about getting Open Data embedded in procurement processes if we can. Devon already put open 
                    data requirements into <a href="https://github.com/DevonCC/strategy/blob/master/Standard%20NFR.md">standard 
                    Non-Functional Requirements</a> for software tenders (although this needs some updating now I look at it again), 
                    but we could go further and automate some aspects of procurement by requiring suppliers to release open data as well. 
                    I think this is probably where G-Cloud is heading.<br><br>
                    <strong>Which data?</strong><br>
                    We moved on to discussing what sort of data sets ought to be prioritized, and it emerged that Hampshire was adopting an 
                    "open by default" approach, trying to pick data sets that might be more interesting based on feedback. Aerial photography – 
                    built in publication of images as open data (as a resampled version) was one of the early things that has proved popular.
                    A suggestion was made (not sure where from, sorry) to have a data request form linked to FOI – so people can request open 
                    data sets via this method [as an addendum, we've just set up <a href="https://trello.com/devondata">this Trello board</a> 
                    so people can see where particular datasets are in the workflow].<br><br>
                    <strong>Design</strong><br>
                    The group talked a bit about making data sets more accessible (this is a topic which is 
                    <a href="defining-data-inclusion.html">very close to our hearts</a>). For some people, 
                    even basic filtering of data is hard.  The group wondered how to make things easier and conversation split into a 
                    number of areas -<br>

                    <ul>
	                    <li>the use of design principles in opening data sets (ie having a user purpose and needs at the centre of 
	                    the process, test and iterate against these real users),</li>
	                    <li>use of "data mentors" to help people get the best out of the data they encounter and minimise the 
	                    risks they may be running in terms of their own personal data (in Devon we have some "digital mentors" 
	                    who do an analogous thing for those who are new to broadband)</li>
	                    <li>the adoption of data tools directly into people's browsing experiences to make it more accessible 
	                    (ie replacing static images of data visualisations with interactive stuff). This is about getting the data in 
	                    front of people's eyeballs in an obvious way.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    Some honourable mentions in this part of the discussion went to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> and 
                    the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/data">Guardian Data Store</a>, as well as 
                    <a href="http://legsb.i-network.org.uk/">LEGSB</a> for its work on accessibility standards.

                    Finally, it was noted that one of the most important aspects to this is  to get away from the town hall 
                    mentality, and resisting storing the data on the council website but using open and accessible public data 
                    repositories (or creating them if we have to).</p>
