        <div class="container">

                    <p>So what’s the problem with open data? Open data is good, right? And as we get better at handling big data, won’t open data get even more valuable?
                    We’ve been here before with other technology innovations. As an ICT person I’ve seen it over and over again: we focus on the shiny new technology before we focus on the problems it needs to solve. We did it with PCs, local area networks, internet, web sites, broadband, smartphones, and so on.
                    And now we’re doing it with open data. We basically throw the technology over the wall at people and expect them to get on with doing amazing things with it – and find we’re disappointed at how little impact it has.
                    And then we move on to the next thing … only for, several years later, Google or Apple to come up with a design that actually solves a problem for people. We had smartphones in 1995, for example, but they didn’t get popular until the iPhone made them usable for normal people.
                    In fact, this pattern is widely understood and enshrined in this model called the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp">Hype Cycle</a> (invented by the analyst firm Gartner).
                    <a href="http://plaindatacampaign.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_2808.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47" src="http://plaindatacampaign.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_2808.jpg?w=474&amp;h=331" alt="Hype Cycle" width="474" height="331" /></a>
                    Here’s the pattern: lots of hype, a massive backlash, and then some people quietly get on with being productive. But <em>everything under the left-hand bump is time wasted.</em>
                    <a href="http://plaindatacampaign.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_2809.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50" src="http://plaindatacampaign.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_2809.jpg?w=474&amp;h=330" alt="Hype Cycle showing waste" width="474" height="330" /></a>Until we understand what productivity means – what the user journeys are – we don’t get productive. And of course, there are lots of these user journeys: perhaps the future of big data is really about billions of small data-enabled journeys rather than the big data processing itself, which will become more commoditised?
                    We are still on the left hand hump with both open and big data for the public sector. There are some very clever people who have made some very clever tools, things like <a href="http://www.social-life.co/project/future-cities-solutions-project-stentor/">Project Stentor</a> and <a href="http://lginform.local.gov.uk/">LG Inform</a>, but they still mostly require an analyst to be between the data and the final beneficiary.
                    This is not intended as a criticism; both of these products are very strong, we’ve met some of the people behind them and they are great and need to continue.
                    But they are back end products – we want to go straight to the end users and serve their needs directly to stop wasting time and money. Products that do this really well, for example, are the <a href="https://citymapper.com/">CityMapper</a> and <a href="http://www.numberhood.net/">Numberhood</a> apps.
                    These last two are interesting because they represent different categories of product: general purpose “interesting” (Numberhood) or solving a specific problem in an intuitive way (CityMapper).
                    What we don’t have in local government as yet is a way of uncovering what the problems are that need solving and so we can’t “do a CityMapper” on them. Partly this is because local government is very complex and there are lots of user journeys to map, so we end up producing general purpose things. Someone needs to step up and start trying to map out what questions are being asked of the local government data.
                    Since we seem to be in a small group of people talking about this, that someone might as well be us.</p>
